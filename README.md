# Book-of-Mormon-stuff


Just some cool stuff with the Book of Mormon. One picks a random verse, another detirmines useless facts about the 
number of verses in different chapters (cause why not, if we went through all the trouble to figure out how many verse are in
each chapter so we could pick a random one)
Maybe I'll do something with this stuff someday.
Also, I'm pretty sure I spelled detirmine wrong.
