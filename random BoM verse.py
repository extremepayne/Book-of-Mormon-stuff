# Random verse generator
# Goal: randomly generate a verse from any part 
# of the Book of Mormon with each verse having 
# an equal probablilty


# imports
import random


# This wil be accomplished by creating a list with 
# each of the verses in the Book of Mormon in it,
# then selecting a random element from that list.


# variable
# This is a dictionary that contains all the information
# needed to kow which verses are in the BoM and which aren't
# (like 1 Nephi 1:21 or Enos 2:1)
# The key is the name of the book
# The vaue (a list) represents both the chapters and their verses.
# Each number in the list is a nuber of verses, the chapter is stated
# implicitly as the index. (Plus one, since chapters start at 1 and indices
# start at 0.)
# I included the number of chapters in each book in a comment at the
# end of every value (list).
